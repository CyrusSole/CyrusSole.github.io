    <div id="Item"><img src="Gallerypics/Samsung-MV900F.jpg" alt="Samsung MV800 Flip-out Vlog digital camera in all 4 colorways"><p>Samsung MV800 Flip-out</p> <p>I've always wanted a camera with a flip screen! This one is super cute. It comes in a pretty red color, but since my current camera is red i might get the pink or white version instead.</p></div>
    <div id="Item"><img src="Gallerypics/sonycybershot.jpg" alt="Sony Cyber Shot DSC-T99 digital camera in green" style="width: 200px;"><p>Sony Cyber Shot DSC-T99</p>
        <p>While the photo quality isn't any better than my current camera, this one is just too cute. I love the lime green color, and the sliding camera cover is fun.</p></div>
        <div id="Item"><img src="Gallerypics/camcolors.png" alt="Nikon COOLPIX S3500 digital camera in all 8 colorways" style="width: 200px;"><p>Nikon COOLPIX S3500</p><p>My current camera's cooler, thinner cousin. I really like my COOLPIX so i wouldn't mind trying another model. This camera comes in a few really good colors, i think i'll have a hard time picking between purple and blue.</p></div>
