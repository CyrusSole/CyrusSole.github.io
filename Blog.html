        <h2>Sketch</h2>
       <p>Usually when I begin a digital drawing, I sketch with a no pressure pen. No pressure pens do not change in size or opacity based on pressure, unlike other pens. I also sketch with a pen size that's a bit larger than what I’d use for line work.</p>
        <h2>Line Art</h2>
        <p>Once I'm happy with the sketch, I jump into the line art. I use a thinner, sharper tool so I can get sharp edges. I also take this step to add any extra details the sketch doesn't make clear.</p>
        <h2>Grey Scale</h2>
        <p>Recently, I started coloring in greyscale first. I’ve heard it helps with picking color values, and making your colors more distinct. I’ve enjoyed it so far, I think It's sped up my coloring process since I'm not worried about color picking.
</p>
        <h2>Colored/Final</h2>
            <p>Lastly, I lay down flat colors and set them as a color layer over my greyscale. I'm pretty happy with this method so far, I can finish pieces pretty quickly. I'd like to keep experimenting, though, maybe find a more “artsy” style.</p>
